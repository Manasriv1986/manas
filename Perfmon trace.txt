Performance Monitor steps :- 

 

Launch command prompt and run it as an administrator.

 

Logman.exe create counter PerfLog-Short -o "c:\perflogs\PerfLog-Short.blg " -f bincirc -v mmddhhmm -max 1024 -c "\LogicalDisk(*)\*" "\Memory\*" "\Network Interface(*)\*" "\Paging File(*)\*" "\PhysicalDisk(*)\*" "\Processor(*)\*" "\Process(*)\*" "\Redirector\*" "\Server\*" "\System\*" "\Thread(*)\*" -si 00:00:01

 

 

- Start the logs with the following commands:

 

Logman.exe start PerfLog-Short

 

 - Please stop the performance logs as soon as the issue returns with the following commands:

 

Logman.exe stop PerfLog-Short

 

 

Please note that these performance logs will need to be started again if the server is rebooted as they do not automatically restart on boot by running the command - Logman.exe start PerfLog-Short
